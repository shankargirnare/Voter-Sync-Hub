# Voter Synchronization Hub

This project is a simple Voting and Address Management System developed using **Java** and **Hibernate**. It allows for the management of persons' data, their voting cards, and addresses. The system supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for person records.

## Features

- **Insert a Person**: Add a new person with their Aadhaar ID, name, voting card, and address.
- **View All Persons**: Display a list of all persons with their Aadhaar, name, voting card, and address.
- **Update a Person**: Update the details of an existing person, including Aadhaar ID, name, voting card, and address.
- **Delete a Person**: Remove a person from the database using their Aadhaar ID.
- **Database Integration**: Uses **Hibernate** ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database operations.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Hibernate ORM**: ORM framework for mapping Java objects to relational database tables.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing the data.
- **Maven**: Build tool for dependency management.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: For managing relational data in Java.
  
## Project Structure

- **Entities**: Contains `Person`, `Address`, and `VotingCard` entities that represent the data models.
- **DAO (Data Access Object)**: Contains methods for interacting with the database to perform CRUD operations.
- **Service**: Contains business logic.
- **Controller**: Manages user input and coordinates between service and DAO layers.
- **Client**: Main entry point that simulates a user interacting with the system via a command-line interface.

### Key Topics Used in Your Project

1. **Java Programming**
   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   - Exception Handling

2. **Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**
   - Hibernate Configuration (`hibernate.cfg.xml`)
   - Entity Classes and Annotations (`@Entity`, `@Id`, `@OneToOne`, `@ManyToOne`, `@JoinColumn`)
   - CRUD Operations with Hibernate (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

3. **JPA (Java Persistence API)**
   - Entity Relationships: One-to-One, Many-to-One
   - Cascade Types (`CascadeType.ALL`, `CascadeType.PERSIST`, etc.)

4. **Database Integration**
   - MySQL Database
   - Database Schema Design (Tables for `Person`, `VotingCard`, `Address`)
   - Database Transactions with Hibernate

5. **Session Management in Hibernate**
   - `SessionFactory` and `Session`
   - Transaction Management in Hibernate (`beginTransaction`, `commit`, etc.)

6. **Maven**
   - Dependency Management
   - Project Build Automation

7. **CRUD Operations**
   - Performing Create, Read, Update, Delete on data entities.
  
### Explanation of Key Directories and Files:

1. **`src/main/java/com/shiv/`**: Contains the main Java code for the project.
   - **`Client`**: Contains the `Client.java` file, which serves as the entry point for running the application. It simulates a user interacting with the system via a command-line interface.
   - **`controller`**: Contains the `Controller.java` class that manages user input and coordinates between the service and DAO layers.
   - **`dao`**: Contains the `Dao.java` class for database operations. It performs CRUD operations for entities like `Person`, `VotingCard`, and `Address`.
   - **`entity`**: Contains the entity classes that represent database tables.
     - **`Address.java`**: Represents the `Address` entity.
     - **`Person.java`**: Represents the `Person` entity.
     - **`VotingCard.java`**: Represents the `VotingCard` entity.
   - **`service`**: Contains the `Service.java` class that holds the business logic and interacts with the DAO layer to perform operations.
   - **`utility`**: Contains the `Utility.java` class, which helps in setting up Hibernate sessions and configuration.

2. **`src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml`**: This is the Hibernate configuration file. It contains the database connection details and Hibernate settings necessary for the ORM framework to interact with the database.

3. **`pom.xml`**: The Maven configuration file for managing dependencies and project build. It defines the libraries needed for Hibernate, MySQL, and other necessary tools.

4. **`README.md`**: Project documentation where this file resides. It contains details about the project, features, setup instructions, etc.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

8. **CLI (Command Line Interface)**
   - User Interaction through Console/Terminal
   - BufferedReader and Scanner for Input Handling
